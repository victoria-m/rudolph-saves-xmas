# Final Project
## Summary
I changed the theme of this project, but it’s still a very similar game to the one I intended to make. In this game, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer needs to keep his schedule free so he can help Santa deliver presents on Christmas. This means he needs to avoid those pesky professors who are trying to give him more homework.

The game has the following features:

1. You can move Rudolph around by clicking on your desired location.
2. You can make Rudolph shoot candy canes by clicking on the candy cane icon on the right of the screen
3. A professor (wizard sprite) spawns on the opposite side of the screen, throw candy canes at him!
4. You can go back and forth between the start and game screens by clicking the play and home buttons.
5. Background music and projectile sound effects
6. Animations

## How to Play
1. Press the play button
2. Move Rudolph around by tapping on your desired location
3. Shoot projectiles by tapping the candy cane icon
4. Defeat all of the professors
5. Reach the end of the screen

## Points
**Total points: 46**
I changed the way the points were allocated because after using SpriteKit I realized I wouldn’t be able to use the UIKit the way I had intended so I tailored the points allocation for SpriteKit.

* Network request/response - 3 pts
* GCD - 2 pts
* Threads - 2 pts
* Full Autolayout - 3 pts
* All available device support - 2 pts (iPhone only)
* Custom SpriteKit drawing - 18 pts (6 things: rudolph, projectiles, professor,
* home button, start game button, foreground, and background)
* UIController/SKScenes - 5 pts (GameViewController, GameScene, StartScene, WinScene, GameOverScene)
* Custom Class - 1 pt (PhysicsCategory)
* Animations - 9 pts (rudolph walk, professor walk, throwing projectiles)
